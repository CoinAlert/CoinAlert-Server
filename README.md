# Base64Site

This site is designed to be an internal utility for enterprises who deal with
hand encoding and decoding of Base64. Examples may include OAuth credentials, or
other secret keys. Instead of using an online, 3rd party service, this tool may
be hosted inside the network to alleviate any worries of logging, sniffing, etc
of sensitive data.
